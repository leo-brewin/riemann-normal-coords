I'm inclinded to make a small change of notation from my first
version of this paper. In that version I used a compact notation like
$x^{.\udk}$ to stand for $x^{d_1} x^{d_2} x^{d_3} ... x^{d_k}$. But I
see no reason to include the dot in the initial expression. That is,
I could equally write $x^{\udk}$ without any risk of ambiguities. I
think I'll stick with this new form.

*** NO NO NO ***

The dot is needed to avoid an ambiguity that would arise for
expressions like

   A_{i_1 i_2 i_3 ... i_n} A^{i_1} A^{i_2} A^{i_3} ... A^{i_n}

and

   A_{i_1 i_2 i_3 ... i_n} A^{i_1 i_2 i_3 ... i_n}

Without the dot, both expressions would be written as

   A_{\ui} A^{\ui}
